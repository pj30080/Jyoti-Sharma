### Hey there! 👋

I'm [Jyoti Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyotisharma-da/), a B.Tech CSE student and an aspiring Data Analyst.

I love exploring data, learning analytical tools, and creating simple but meaningful projects.
Whenever an idea comes into my mind, I try to build it, test it, and improve it step by step.

My main tools include Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Excel, and Matplotlib.
Right now, I'm focusing on data cleaning, visualization, and beginner-level machine learning.
